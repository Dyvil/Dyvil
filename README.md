Dyvil is a multi-paradigm, general purpose programming language that is based on Java and the JVM.
Specifically, it can be classified as strongly typed, object-oriented and parallel, with functional and imperative elements and dynamic typing support.
Dyvil extends Java with several new and modern language features.

As a new programming language in active development, the main aims behind Dyvil are the following:

- to **enhance** Java with modern programming language elements
- to **avoid** common boilerplate code
- to **give** programmers full **control** over the syntax and semantics of their code
- to be fully **compatible** and **inter-operable** with Java and other JVM languages (e.g. Scala, Groovy, etc.)
